      I still vividly remember the feelings of awe and wonder when discovering the internet back when it first started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dialing in over a phone line and waiting impatiently for text and images to load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the frustration when the line broke up, or when the page ultimately failed to load at all, there was
      that sense of a promising future that I could not articulate.<br/>
      I was in anticipation of things to come, and eager to be a part “this new thing”.
      So I took up IT courses, and 4 years later obtained my degree in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the emphasis of the program was on Software Engineering, and Object Oriented programming. <br/>
      Although this was not what I initially set out to do, as I wanted to work specifically on something related to the
      internet, to my
      surprise I quite liked thinking about software problems.<br/>
      I started to see how some solutions were elegant, and others weren’t. I learned about design patterns. I learned
      about
      modules. And composition. Multi-tiered architecture.<br/>
      This was all new technology at the time, and great improvement on the mainframe architectures that were still
      prevalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, development for the browser was tedious. <br/> There was no CSS, or it was in it's very early stages.
      Pages were laid out
      in tables, often using cut and paste photoshop images to liven up the design. Javascript functionality and
      adoption
      was very limited. <br/>
      The web was not the yet the exiting place it has come to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, I have honed my skills as software engineer for several years, away from the internet, often away
      even from
      user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately web browser capabilities have increased steadily over the years,
      <!-- Thanks to standardization efforts from a certain number of companies and individuals. Mention something about
      the tech industry , community and open source? -->
      and with the advent of Single Page Applications I realized application development for the browser had finally
      become a reality.
      I immediately changed course and have specialized in HTML5, CSS and Javascript from then on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have developed and designed many interfaces since then. While working closely with UX-designers on
      several projects, I have grown aware of the importance of good UX design. In fact, these days, as the technology
      has
      matured, the challenge has shifted from producing working software to creating user-friendly applications.
      I have seen first hand the improvements introduced by these design methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question has become:
    </p>
    <p class="about-quote">
      <a href="https://medium.com/interactive-mind/ux-is-useless-a2b423f3216c" target="_blank">“Are you going to push features or create an experience?“</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, designing software algorithms has taught me to think in a structured way, while always aware of the
      overarching context the software was a part of. I have learned to be creative within the technical and
      environmental
      constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about the user experience and designing for it is similar. We learn from users what their preferences
      are.
      What is intuitive to them. How they tend to structure their environment.
      Coming up with creative solutions within these constraints requires much the same aptitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, designing for users also draws from important soft skills. Cognitive or emotional empathy, self-awareness
      and
      interpersonal communication.
      It requires humility to understand that a particular solution you favor is maybe not the best solution given the
      situation. When designing for other people ego and attachment have no place.
      UX design is all about data and facts. Not about personal preferences.
      Having to put yourself in the shoes of others to be able to come up with a solution that is uniquely tailored for
      them is both
      challenging and gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the web has evolved, it has more than realized the potential I presumed it had when it was in its infancy. The
      web
      is no longer just the web, but has become the Internet Of Things. A grid that connects everything. We now interact
      with computers verbally (Alexa, Siri). In Asian countries robots are already a part of daily life. <br/>
      All of these experiences need to be carefully designed for.<br/>
      I’m very excited to be increasingly focusing my attention on user experience and service design in the coming
      years.
