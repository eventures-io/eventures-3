    I build and design user interfaces
  </p>
  <p>
    When I started out in software development, most of the challenge in producing software was
    technical. Especially so in web development.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days, the technology has matured, and the challenge has shifted from producing working software to
    creating user-friendly applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    This requires a human centered approach, very different from the traditional software development cycle and
    methodologies.
    <br/>The question has become:
  </p>
  <p class="about-quote">
    “Are you going to push features or create an experience“
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to create a good user experience it is necessary to start from of a contextual view of both the
    business and the users: Understand the business goals and business drivers. (the why of the
    business). Understand how the product can fulfill users needs. Distill engaging user journeys from this information.
  </p>
  <p>
    My task as user experience designer is to be able to abstract away the business goals, and map them to goals
    and tasks that are relevant to the user.

  <p class="about-quote">
    “Because users don’t care about <span class="about-quote__italic">your</span> solution, they care about
    <span class="about-quote__italic">their</span> problem”
  </p>
  <p>
    This means a project is successful if:
  </p>
  <ul class="success-list">
    <li>
      <span class="drawing-list-item one"></span><span>The user can accomplish his task (Business goals are met)</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="drawing-list-item two"></span><span>The user can do so easily, with minimal friction (User friendliness goal met)</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        class="drawing-list-item three"></span><span> The is process enjoyable for the user (A good user experience)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
