    When I started out in software development, most of the challenge in producing software was
    technical. Especially so in web development.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days, the technology has matured, and the challenge has shifted from producing working software to
    creating user-friendly applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    This requires a human centered approach, very different from the traditional software development cycle and
    methodologies.
    <br/>The question has become:
  </p>
  <p class="about-quote">
    “Are you going to push features or create an experience“
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to create a good user experience it is necessary to start from of a contextual view of the
    users, the problem at hand, and the business. Understand the business goals and business drivers. (the why of the
    business). Understand how the product can fulfill users' needs. Distill engaging user journeys from this information.
  </p>
  <p>
    My task as user experience designer is to be able to abstract away the business goals, and map them to goals
    and tasks that are relevant to the user.

  <p class="about-quote">
    “Because users don’t care about <span class="about-quote__italic">your</span> solution, they care about
    <span class="about-quote__italic">their</span> problem”
  </p>
  <p>
    This means a project is successful if:
  </p>
  <ul class="success-list">
    <li>
      <span class="drawing-list-item one"></span><span>The user can accomplish his task (Business goals are met)</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="drawing-list-item two"></span><span>The user can do so easily, with minimal friction (User friendliness goal met)</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        class="drawing-list-item three"></span><span> The is process enjoyable for the user (A good user experience)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
