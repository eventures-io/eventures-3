          Turnip is a hybrid mobile app built with Ionic2.

          It manages food recipes, prints out the ingredients lists, suggests recipes based on local products in season.

          I found myself in need of organizing my recipes, as they were scattered over multiple text files,
          notes and image files.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I want to access them when cooking, obviously, but also need access to the list of ingredients when
          shopping, I created a mobile app to install on iPad and mobile phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipes are entered on a Wordpress site, accessible to the app through the Wordpress REST API.

          The home screen shows recipes based on seasonal ingredients, and user preferences.
          (e.g. vegetarian, Asian...).
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipes on the home screen can be filtered by clicking the filter button and selecting a predefined
          filter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search screen allows for detailed search by ingredient, course type, or free text.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the recipe screen, the export to export to shopping list button exports all ingredients to a shopping list.
          This list can be edited, and items can be deleted. <br/>
          A checkbox marks purchased items in strike trough.

      <h3>Experience with Ionic2</h3>
      <p>
        Building with Ionic does speed up the development process.
        I was able build a mobile app rapidly, having only knowledge of html, css and Javascript.
        Performance is very good, virtually indistinguishable from native.
      </p>
      <p>
        Javascript issues can easily be solved by using the debugger in the browser.
        The emulator can now be used with live reload, so that even scripts that access native functionality
        can be changed and tested on the fly.
      <p>
      <p>
        Platform specific issues do pop up.
        For example the splash screen on android is buggy, and doesn't work out of the box.
        The rendering in the emulator is different from the rendering of the app installed on the device.
        Overriding the default CSS styles requires a good understanding of the Ionic platform.<br/>
        In order to create a finished application, calculating 20% overhead to solve these types of issues seems
        mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a production environment however, these concerns can be delegated to key people in the team with in-depth
        knowledge of
        Ionic or the mobile platform. This is obviously not the case in native app development, where every developer
        needs thorough knowledge of the platform in order to be able to code.<br/>
        The framework is ideal for rapid prototyping, as it allows to make changes easily, and deployment is effortless.
