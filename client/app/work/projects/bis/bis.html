        Bank Of International Settlements wants do a makeover of the their stats visualisation application.
        The design has become outdated, and it relies on older technologies, which are proving difficult to maintain.

      <h3>Technical challenges:</h3>

      <p>
        BIS is teaming up with a third party that provides an abstraction layer on top of the SDMX back-end.
        The application is to interface with a javascript library that handles calls to the back end and returns
        wrappers around data ojects.
        The library expects callbacks instead of returning promises, which increases complexity in synchronizing results
        from different back-end calls.
        The library is also quite unstable, with little or no error handling implementation, which causes the UI to
        freeze in case of type errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        To mitigate problems caused by the above design, I proposed two possible options:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Move the library behind a web worker, so that calls are executed on a separate thread. In case of severe
          errors, the UI thread will not be affected. There will also be a perceived performance benefit, since the main
          thread will not
          freeze
          during processing.
          The caller of the webworker can set a timeout for the return of the message, thus implementing some form of
          error handling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wrap the calls to the library in an observable. The observable will use an anonymous callback function to pass
          to the library,
          and has a reference to itself within the callback to return the result. This allows a timeout
          operator to be executed in case an error occurs in the library and no result is returned.
          All sequence handling can be done using promise chaining or RXJS operators as necessary.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the fact that the third party library has a dependency on JQuery, the first option can be problematic.
        Even if workarounds for this issue seem to exist, implementing a service worker would put an already tight
        deadline
        under even more pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second option, easier and faster to implement, was retained, but keeps the UI at risk of freezing.
