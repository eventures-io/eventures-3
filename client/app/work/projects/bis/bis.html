            The design has become outdated, and it relies on older technologies, which are proving difficult to
            maintain.

          <p>
            To allow reuse of visual components, and easily remodel the interface without breaking code changes,
            I suggest using a single page application framework.
            The development team at BIS has already used Angular.js in the past, so Angular2 seems to make a good choice.

        <h3>Technical challenges:</h3>

        <p>
          BIS is teaming up with a third party that provides an abstraction layer on top of the SDMX back-end.
          The application is to interface with a javascript library that handles calls to the back end and returns
          wrappers around data ojects.
          The library expects callbacks instead of returning promises, which increases complexity in synchronizing
          results
          from different back-end calls.
          The library is also quite unstable, with little or no error handling implementation, which causes the UI to
          freeze in case of type errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          To mitigate problems caused by the above design, I proposed two possible options:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Move the library behind a web worker, so that calls are executed on a separate thread. In case of severe
            errors, the UI thread will not be affected. There will also be a perceived performance benefit, since the
            main
            thread will not
            freeze
            during processing.
            The caller of the webworker can set a timeout for the return of the message, thus implementing some form of
            error handling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrap the calls to the library in an observable. The observable will use an anonymous callback function to
            pass
            to the library,
            and has a reference to itself within the callback to return the result. This allows a timeout
            operator to be executed in case an error occurs in the library and no result is returned.
            All sequence handling can be done using promise chaining or RXJS operators as necessary.
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Given the fact that the third party library has a dependency on JQuery, the first option can be problematic.
          Even if workarounds for this issue seem to exist, implementing a service worker would put an already tight
          deadline under even more pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second option, easier and faster to implement, was retained, but keeps the UI at risk of freezing.

        <h3>Current state</h3>
        <p>
          Below is an image of the current state of the application. <br>
          It has been designed to display as much information within the same view as possible.<br>
          The font size is quite small, with little padding or margins, giving a condensed impression.<br>
          The white border around some of the panel creates a leveled effect, which feels out of place.<br>
          The text and header fonts are the same, and the header font size is barely bigger then the text font.<br>
        </p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>
          The issues with the current design are twofold:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The screen is cluttered, and the visual design exacerbates this impression.</li>
          <li>The screen is not responsive.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>
        <h3>Possible solutions</h3>
        <p>
          To make the screen responsive one could:
        </p>
        <ul class="solutions-list">
          <li>
            Put the tabs in a fixed with container, and let that container scroll when overflowing.
            Add buttons to the left and right to scroll.
            <img class="prjct-img-size-md" src="assets/images/bis/wf-dktp-open.png">
          </li>
          <li>
            Stack the tabs vertically and move them to a drawer on the left.
            <img class="prjct-img-size-md" src="assets/images/bis/wf-drawer-open.png">
          </li>
          <li>
            Move the tabs to a dropdown
            <img class="prjct-img-size-md" src="assets/images/bis/wf-dropdown-open.png">
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The first solution has the advantage to be easily scannable. All content is presented in one tab.
          The current selected dataset and query are clearly visible.
          The grouping of the query selection and its filter items reduces cognitive load.
          This layout also scales well, as the layout largely stays the same over the different screen sizes.
          The inconvenience of this option is that on smaller screens most of the tabs will hidden,
          and the user needs to scroll for each tab change. There is no visual overview of all the categories.
          <!--The application is less suitable for very small screens, due to the rendering of the results is pivot tables, -->
          <!--so this -->
          <!--Due rendering of the data in pivot tables, the application is by nature less suitable for mobile devices.-->
          <!--It is possible to optimize for small screens by changing the direction of the scroll to vertical and have the container -->
          <!--overflow , and thus create a -->
          <!--dropdown. -->
        </p>
        <p>
          The second option is also viable. The layout feels less cohesive however, and the catories are hidden on all
          screen sizes. The application is used primarily on large desktops, which makes this a less optimal solution.
          Potentially this view could be triggered only when the screen is to small to display the tabs side by side.
          This is difficult to achieve however because the number of tabs and the size of the tabs are dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third option would go against the general recommendation to not use dropdowns when there is a need to
          single
          out
          the location of the current section of the site. For that reason this solution needs not to be presented
          to the client as possible option.

        The new design needs to conform to the look and feel of current BIS website,
        which restricts the options for redesign severely. In order to comply with these constraints, and sufficiently
        reduce the cluttered aspect of the previous design, I opted to use a white background wherever possible.

        The application keeps a dense impression, because of the many panels, but the situation has improved.
        To make a more obvious distinction between headers and text without introducing a new font,
        headers are made uppercase.

        The client asked to make the run query button more prominent.
        To stay within the given color palette, instead of changing the color of the run button,
        I changed the color of the other buttons to white,
        making the run button stand out.
