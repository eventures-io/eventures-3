            To help maritime shipping companies be compliant with international en local emissions regulations,
            Polestar wants to extend it's vessel monitoring systems to include engine emissions data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information collected by sensors installed on the exhaust of the vessels is transferred to a central
            database.
            This information can then be queried, and displayed in charts.
          </p>
          <p>
            It allows fleet managers to see in real time which ships are compliant/non compliant, the position and
            bearing
            of each ship,
            and to drill down into historical data of the ship to see how it performs overtime.

          This application is to integrate within the new Polestar platform, which is being built with Angular2.

          Typescript has proven very useful when working with D3.js. It allowed to wrap several D3 components in classes
          to create a reusable horizontal (based on time scale) axis and vertical (based on ordinal scale) axis.

          Each of the graph types extends an abstract class that holds references to common methods and object
          instances.

          Calculation of compliance/non-compliance is done on the client. I have used turf-inside,
          a small open source library that determines weather a given point is in a polygon.
          This allows to determine if a vessel is in or out of an ECA zone, and calculate compliance.
          The polygon is defined by location data loaded in Geo-JSON format.

          The ECA zones are marked in black on the map.<br/>
          Vessels compliant with regulations are marked in green, non-compliant vessels are marked in red.
          The vessels are oriented according to their heading.

          The graph view can render op to 6 (and potentially more) categories of emission data.
          It then becomes difficult to position the legends for each of the graphs along the axis.<br>
          In addition, as the legend text is in the same color as the graph, the lack of contrast can make the text
          difficult to read.<br/>

          I suggested to use the hover state of the cursor over the graph to hide/show relative legends.
          On hover over a graph element, hide all other then the legends then that from the graph with mouse over.
