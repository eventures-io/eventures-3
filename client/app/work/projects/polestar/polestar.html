      Polestar space solutions want to provide customers with additional layers to their existing weather
      maps.
      The new weather+ service will display maps with ocean wave and current models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existing layout is based on a list of select boxes contained in an accordion layout container.
      Polestar chose to add two more elements to the accordion.

     <span class="image-link"
           onclick="openImageModal('polestar/polestar-1.png')">The design looked like this</span>.
    <p>
      This approach presents a number of usability issues:
    <ol>
      <li><span class="drawing-list-item one"></span>
        The user cannot see at a glance which layers are selected, as they are either hidden by a
        collapsed
        state of the container element or because the accordion element overflows in its container.
        This is a breach of the “visibility of system status” heuristic criterion. It increases
        cognitive
        load and requires additional actions from the user.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="drawing-list-item two"></span>
        The first layer is selected by clicking a radio button, styled as a toggle switch.
        This is neither consistent nor intuitive.
        It makes the user think: What happens if I push that button?
        Is it some sort of filter? Why is different from the other layer selections?
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="drawing-list-item three"></span>
        Similarly, the layers from the currents group are selected by pressing radio buttons.
        This violates the “consistency and standards” heuristic criterion,
        and the “don’t make me think” principle.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      In a first attempt to address these problems, I proposed to add the selected layers above the
      accordion
      element, in the form of clickable pills, and remove the selected layers from the layers list.
      The accordion can only have one element open at the time, which eliminates the need to scroll.
      All layers are also consistently selectable by a select box.
      <br/>
                <span class="image-link"
                      onclick="openImageModal('polestar/polestar-2.png')">This is the second version</span>.

    </p>

    <p>
      This design improves on the previous but is still not user-friendly.
      Even if the system state is visible at all times, it is hard to read. In addition to that,
      there are multiple sliders, each holding state.
      <br/>
      In short, the screen is to complex. A better solution was required.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason the selection status is hard to read is because the selected layers are displayed inside
      their
      proper group container.<br/>
      It would be better to move all selected layers to the top, so they become more apparent.
      <br/>
      Also, there is no need to have separate sliders for each group, as it would not make sense to
      overlay
      maps from different time frames. Given that the accordion headers take up so much vertical space,
      the accordion is to be replaced by a carousel.
    </p>
    <p>
                    <span class="image-link"
                          onclick="openImageModal('polestar/polestar-3.png')">The final design </span>
      eliminates all issues with previous versions and offers added flexibility to navigate through the
      layer
      groups (choice between group icon buttons and previous/next buttons).
      <br/>It also allows more groups to be added later on without negatively impacting usability.
      The reclaimed vertical space can be used to add a filter field.
