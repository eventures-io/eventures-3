            Polestar Global wants to offer customers additional layers to their existing weather maps.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have partnered up with Tidetech, a company which provides ocean wave and tidal current models.
          </p>
          <p>
            These models help shipping companies choose the most optimal route to reduce fuel consumption and fuel
            emissions.

              The existing layout for the selection of the maps is based on a list of select boxes contained in an
              accordion layout container.
              Polestar chose to add two more elements to the accordion.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach presents a number of usability issues:
            <ol>
              <li><span class="drawing-list-item one"></span>
                The user cannot see at a glance which layers are selected, as they are either hidden by a
                collapsed
                state of the container element or because the accordion element overflows in its container.
                This is a breach of the “visibility of system status” heuristic criterion. It increases
                cognitive
                load and requires additional actions from the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="drawing-list-item two"></span>
                The first layer is selected by clicking a radio button, styled as a toggle switch.
                This is neither consistent nor intuitive.
                It makes the user think: What happens if I switch that button?
                Is it some sort of filter? Why is it different from the other layer selections?
              </li>

              <li>
                <span class="drawing-list-item three"></span>
                Similarly, the layers from the currents group are selected by pressing radio buttons.
                This violates the “consistency and standards” heuristic criterion,
                and the “don’t make me think” principle.
              </li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            In a first attempt to address these problems, I proposed to add the selected layers above the
            accordion
            element, in the form of clickable pills, and remove the selected layers from the layers list.
            The accordion can only have one element open at the time, which eliminates the need to scroll.
            All layers are also consistently selectable by a select box.
          </p>

          <p>
            This design improves on the previous but is still not user-friendly.
            Even if the system state is visible at all times, it is hard to read. In addition to that,
            there are multiple sliders, each holding state.
            <br/>
            In short, the screen is to complex. A better solution was required.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reason the selection status is hard to read is because the selected layers are displayed inside
            their
            proper group container.<br/>
            It would be better to move all selected layers to the top, so they become more apparent.
            <br/>
            Also, there is no need to have separate sliders for each group, as it would not make sense to
            overlay
            maps from different time frames. Given that the accordion headers take up so much vertical space,
            the accordion is to be replaced by a carousel.
          </p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-7">
          <p>
            The final design
            eliminates all issues with previous versions and offers added flexibility to navigate through the
            layer groups (choice between group icon buttons and previous/next buttons).
            <br/>It also allows more groups to be added later on without negatively impacting usability.
            The reclaimed vertical space can be used to add a filter field.

          Working with Web Map Services (WMS) is not well supported by Leaflet.<br/>
          In order to work with the Tidetech endpoints I had to extend Leaflet with
          first a NonTiledLayer to be able to render images defined by the coordinates of its corners, and a WMS layer
          that
          is able to handle the getCapabilities request of the WMS api.

          Interval selection can be made by using the slider handle, or by clicking the increment/decrement buttons.
          The slider is an Angular2 component based on HTML5 range input.
